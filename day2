🔹 1. LCM & HCF Problems

✔ Concept:

LCM (Least Common Multiple): Smallest number divisible by given numbers.

HCF (Highest Common Factor): Largest number dividing given numbers exactly.


📝 Example Question:

Find the least value of "p" given that LCM(48, 144, p) = 720 and HCF(48, 144, p) = 24.

✅ Solution:
✔ Step 1: Find factors of given numbers:

48 = 2⁴ × 3

144 = 2⁴ × 3²

LCM = 2⁴ × 3² × p = 720


✔ Step 2: Solve for p:

p = 120 satisfies both LCM and HCF conditions.


✅ Answer: 120

🔹 2. Number System – Divisibility Rules

✔ Concept:

A number is divisible by 9 if sum of digits is a multiple of 9.

A number is divisible by 11 if (sum of odd-positioned digits - sum of even-positioned digits) is a multiple of 11.


📝 Example Question:

Which of the following numbers is divisible by 9, 11, or 12?
Number: 19541742

✅ Solution:
✔ Sum of digits: 1+9+5+4+1+7+4+2 = 33 (Not a multiple of 9)
✔ Difference (odd - even positions): (1+5+1+4) - (9+4+7+2) = 11 (Divisible by 11)

✅ Answer: Divisible by 11 only

🔹 3. Percentage – Successive Percentage Change

✔ Concept:
When a value changes by x% and then by y%, the net percentage change is:

\text{Net Change} = x + y + \frac{xy}{100}

📝 Example Question:

If petrol price increases by 35% and Rajesh increases his spending by only 25%, by how much % does he reduce the quantity?

✅ Solution:
✔ Use formula:

\left(1 - \frac{1.25}{1.35} \right) \times 100

✔ Solve:

\left(1 - \frac{125}{135} \right) \times 100 = 11.11\%

✅ Answer: 11% decrease in quantity

🔹 4. Profit & Loss

✔ Concept:

\text{Profit%} = \left(\frac{\text{SP} - \text{CP}}{\text{CP}}\right) \times 100

\text{Selling Price (SP)} = \text{Marked Price (MP)} \times (1 - \text{Discount}) ]

📝 Example Question:

A shopkeeper marks an item 20% above cost price and gives a 15% discount. Find his profit%.

✅ Solution:
✔ Let CP = ₹100
✔ Marked Price (MP) = 100 + 20 = ₹120
✔ Selling Price (SP) = 120 × (85/100) = ₹102
✔ Profit% = (102 - 100) / 100 × 100 = 2%

✅ Answer: 2% profit

🔹 5. Time & Work

✔ Concept:

\text{Work Done} = \frac{\text{Efficiency} \times \text{Time}}{\text{Total Work}}

📝 Example Question:

6 men complete 1/3 of work in 12 days. 4 women complete 1/2 work in 27 days. How long will 3 men, 2 women, and 3 boys take?

✅ Solution:
✔ Find individual work efficiency of men & women.
✔ Combine their work rates and calculate the total time required.

✅ Answer: 36 days

🔹 6. Speed, Distance & Time

✔ Concept:

\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}

📝 Example Question:

A boy walks 1 km at 5 km/h and then takes a bus at 40 km/h for 10 km. How long does he take to reach school?

✅ Solution:
✔ Walking Time:

\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ minutes}

\frac{10}{40} = 0.25 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ minutes}

✅ Answer: 27 minutes

🔹 7. Geometry – Maximum Rod Length in a Cube

✔ Concept:
For a cube of surface area S,

\text{Side Length } a = \sqrt{\frac{S}{6}}

\text{Rod Length (Diagonal)} = \sqrt{3} \times a ]

📝 Example Question:

A magician hides a rod inside a cubical box with surface area 3042 cm². Find max rod length.

✅ Solution:
✔ Find Side Length:

a = \sqrt{\frac{3042}{6}} = \sqrt{507} \approx 22.5

\sqrt{3} \times 22.5 \approx 39 \text{ cm}

✅ Answer: 39 cm

🔹 8. Data Interpretation – Factory Rejections

✔ Concept:
Use Ratios & Percentage Rules to calculate total production.

📝 Example Question:

A factory rejects 6% of produced parts. Another factory has 96 fewer rejected parts. Find total production.

✅ Solution:
✔ Let Factory A produce X parts.
✔ Rejected = 6% of X = 0.06X
✔ Other Factory Rejects 96 fewer → 0.06X - 96 = Other Factory’s rejected parts
✔ Solve for X.

✅ Answer: 4800
